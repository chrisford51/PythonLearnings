# Chaining Comparison Operators
# We can use logical operators to combine comparisons:
and
or
not

and needs both args to be True
or needs either args to be True

1 == 1 # Returns True
# We use the not operator if we want to return the opposite bool. 

not(1==1) # Returns false 
not 1 == 1 # also works
