# Normal Operators

print(2+1) # prints 3
print(2-1) # prints 1
print(2+2) # prints 4
print(3/2) # prints 1.5

# Modulo or "Mod" Operator
#
# Good for checking if something is divisible by something or checking to see if a number is even

print(7/4) # prints 1.75, but if you want the remainder specifically, use the '%' below
print(7 % 4) # prints the remainder of 3
print(50 % 5) # prints 0 since there is no remainder
print(23 % 2) # good way to check if a number is even, since the remainder should be 0. Prints 1
print(20 % 2) # prints 0, so number is even. 

# Exponential function

print(2 ** 3) # 2 to the power of 3, prints 8.

# Order of Operations

print(2 + 10 * 10 + 3) # prints 105 since PEMDAS
print((2+10) * (10+3)) # prints 156 because I manipulated the values with parentheses.
